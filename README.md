## üéØ Overview

**GreenGuard** is an AI-powered tool that analyzes corporate ESG and sustainability reports to detect greenwashing - misleading environmental claims that deceive consumers and undermine genuine sustainability efforts.

Built in under 24 hours for [Cal Hacks 12.0](https://calhacks.io/) as a solo beginner project, GreenGuard addresses the multi-billion dollar greenwashing problem by making corporate environmental accountability accessible to everyone.

### The Problem

- Companies spend billions on "green" marketing without substantive environmental action
- Consumers lack tools to verify sustainability claims
- Vague terms like "eco-friendly" and "carbon neutral" are used without proof
- Greenwashing enables climate inaction and deceives vulnerable communities

### The Solution

GreenGuard uses advanced pattern recognition to analyze sustainability reports and detect the "7 Sins of Greenwashing":

1. **Hidden Trade-offs** - Emphasizing one green attribute while ignoring larger harm
2. **No Proof** - Environmental claims without certification or evidence
3. **Vagueness** - Poorly defined terms like "eco-friendly" or "natural"
4. **Irrelevance** - Truthful but unimportant claims
5. **Lesser of Two Evils** - Green claims on inherently problematic products
6. **Fibbing** - Outright false environmental claims
7. **False Labels** - Creating fake certifications or misleading imagery

   - Count vague environmental terms
   - Check for third-party verification keywords
   - Identify quantifiable metrics (%, CO2, kWh)
   - Detect timelines and baselines
3. Calculate credibility score:
   - Base score: 50
   - +20 for verification
   - +15 for metrics
   - +10 for timelines
   - -3 per vague term
4. Generate specific warning signs
5. Provide contextual recommendations

## üéì Background & Inspiration

GreenGuard was created by Angelina Cayabyab with a background in:
- **Corporate ESG** - Bay Area Air District, Management Consulting (Genentech, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Ultragenyx, Novozymes, BlackBerry, 5 Startups). 
- **UC Berkeley MPH** (Master of Public Health) - Environmental Health
- **UC Davis MBA** - Business strategy and corporate responsibility
- **Georgia Tech OMSCS** - ML/AI

### Why This Matters

Greenwashing is not just misleading marketing - it's an environmental justice issue:
- Vulnerable communities bear the actual environmental burden
- Real sustainable businesses struggle to compete
- Progress on climate change is undermined
- Billions in consumer spending is misdirected

GreenGuard democratizes ESG analysis, making expert-level scrutiny accessible to everyone.
